    <P>I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
    Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
    Then there's a pair of us!<br>
    Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br>
    </P>
    <p>How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
        How public - like a Frog -<br>
        To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br>
        To an admiring Bog!<br>
    </p>
